     <p>
      This is an implementation
      of <a href="https://class.coursera.org/modelthinking/lecture/16">Schelling's
      spatial segregation model</a> in JavaScript. This is an
      agent-based model in which the agents (the red and purple dots,
      in this case) represent two groups choosing residential
      locations. Each agent decides whether it is happy or unhappy in
      a neighborhood based on whether its neighbors are like it or
      not. There is a threshold for the percentage of like neighbors
      required to be happy. For instance, if the threshold is 25% and
      2 out of 8 neighbors are like the agent, the agent will be
      happy. However, if the threshold is 35%, the agent will not be
      happy and will move. The lighter dots represent unhappy agents,
      while the darker dots represent happy agents.
     </p>

     <p>
       What is interesting about the model is that, even with a
       relatively low threshold, say 30%, extreme segregation
       results. Thus, fairly tolerant agents end up in segregated
       neighborhoods despite a tolerance for diversity.
     <p>

     <p>
       The threshold has already been described. The fill factor
       determines what percentage of grid cells are occupied; for
       instance, a 95% fill factor leaves 5% of the cells vacant. The
       grid size simply determines how large the simulation grid
       is. The balance slider determines the balance between members
       of one group and members of another; if set to 50% there will
       be the same number of red and purple agents.
     </p>

     <p>
       The numbers on the right show the mean percentage of like
       neighbors and the percentage of unhappy cells. The mean
       percentage of like neighbors is the arithmetic mean of the
       percentages of like neighbors to total neighbors for each
       cell. More segregated layouts have higher numbers. The
       percentage of unhappy cells is the percentage of the cells that
       are currently unhappy. The graphs show the progression of these
       statistics over the course of the model run.
     </p>

     <p>
       The model is initialized by placing the cells randomly on the
       board. On each step of the model, a randomly selected unhappy
       cell is moved to a randomly selected vacant cell; the display
       updates every 20 steps. The interface was inspired by
       the <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Segregation">NetLogo
       Segregation model</a>, and the choice of a random vacant cell
       as the destination of each move was inspired
       by <a href="http://web.mit.edu/rajsingh/www/lab/alife/schelling.html">Raj
       Singh's implementation.</a> Edge effects are corrected by
       treating the space as a torus; the top row is considered
       adjacent to the bottom row and the rightmost column is considered
       adjacent to the leftmost column.
